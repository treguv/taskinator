# Taskinator
Taskinator is a web app built to allow you to keep track of tasks that need to be done. It does so by providing you with a column for tasks to do, tasks in progress, and tasks completed. The app allows you to save tasks and update their status as you work on them. It also allows you to edit the tasks content and remove them once no longer needed.
